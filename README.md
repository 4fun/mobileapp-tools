===============

Show me the tools, I&#39;ll build the world.

This repository introduces new developers to the fantastic world of Phonegap (http://phonegap.com/about) that Turpial team will use to build the Turpial mobile app. In these tutorials we will try to build a simil-twitter application and find the best tools to develop with Phonegap, for example iScroll to scroll pages or Lawnchair to save data. Enjoy :)

Before start please read the Phonegap Get Started Guide http://phonegap.com/start

- Tutorial 1 (Our first Phonegap application and iScroll):
In this tutorial we are going to implement a simple interface to show a runtime created timeline, using the scroll and playing a sound on start. The amazing thing we want to show is that we are using the same css and media resources of Turpial for desktop.

- Tutorial 2 (A simple template system compatible with Turpial templates):
In this tutorial we are going to implement a simple template system that is able to read a template file and create some html code representing a tweet just passing a hash table like this {username : "myusername", message : "My first tweet" } etc.. You can find the implementation in js/templates.js

- Tutorial 3 (Moving between pages):
We don't want to show only the timeline. We need now to create a cool menu that allows us to switch between stream tweets, mentions, directs and shows our profile. We don't need to define pages for the moment, just make a better header, the menu and the engine, that is the main part of this tutorial.
